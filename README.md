Hangman/Wheel of fortune game using JS, SASS. 

This was my "JavaScript Capstone" project for my bootcamp. 

**In order to play, you need to be on a laptop or desktop computer (it requires a physical keyboard).**

Essentially, a random word will generate, and a user will try to guess the word by logging a keystroke on their physical keyboard. If the letter is correct, the corresponding block will fill with that letter; if it's incorrect, the chance counter will decrease by 1, and the letter will be placed in the "WRONG LETTERS" box. After 5 incorrect answers, the game is over.
